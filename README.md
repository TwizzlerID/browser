## FAQ

### Holla: How does it compare to other browsers like Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Brave?
Both Firefox and Brave are great, and each day Holla is getting closer to their privacy situation. Holla is in good condition to be used daily. It offers a great experience to test the limits of the web and help make the internet a safer place.

### Why is Electron Infrastructure Used?
Some people are often skeptical about Electron due to its high memory usage. :D, but [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) makes the development process incredibly simple and offers very low CPU and memory usage. Electron allows us to build a desktop application using web technologies.

Compared to Chrome, 1080p Video Processing also gives very good results.<br>

### How experimental is Holla? Can I yet process sensitive data about it?
For now use should stop doing anything very delicate on Holla, it is still in development and bugs can always happen and it is constantly being improved,
however, like all applications, problems can occur and go unnoticed.

### How do I know Holla doesn't take telemetry?
Holla is built around on open source technologies and therefore we love transparency. You're welcome to perform your own audits on our entirely open source code! We also include a [Components](https://github.com/meforce/holla/wiki/Components) entry in our docs which breaks down all the technologies used in the production of Holla.

### [Components](https://github.com/meforce/holla/wiki/Components)
Holla strongly supports accessible transparency. This file gives you an insight into each of the components that make up our browser, without having to dig deep into the code to find it.<br>
Instructions and documents containing the materials and components used in the project.
